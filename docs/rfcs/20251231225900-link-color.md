# Release v1.3.2 - Dark Mode Fixes

## Summary
Release v1.3.2 addresses a critical usability issue where wikilinks were improperly styled on dark-themed websites, rendering them invisible or difficult to read. This release changes the underlying DOM element and CSS strategy to ensure wikilinks inherit native site styling while maintaining their distinct dashed underline.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Adaptive Styling
-   **Element Change**: Converted the wikilink container from a `<span>` to an `<a>` tag with `href="javascript:void(0)"`. This allows the element to inherit the target website's default link color and hover states automatically.
-   **CSS Updates**:
    -   Removed fixed `color: #0969da`.
    -   Changed `border-bottom-color` to `currentColor`. This ensures the specific "wikilink" underline matches inheriting text color dynamically, whether in light or dark mode.

### 2. Constraints
-   **Nesting**: Added logic to prevent creating wikilinks inside existing `<a>` or `<button>` tags to avoid invalid HTML nesting and broken interactivity.

## Decision Log
-   **Inheritance vs. Fixed**: logic was switched to full inheritance to support the infinite variety of website themes (Dark Reader, native dark modes, high contrast) without maintaining complex theme detection logic.
