# RFC: Wikilink Helper Extension Initial Release

**ZID**: 20251231143304
**Date**: 2025-12-31
**Status**: Implemented

## Summary
Development of a Chrome extension to detect and interact with wikilinks (e.g., `[[Timestamp-ID|Text]]`) on web pages.

## Implementation Details

### Goals
- Improve readability of wikilinks on GitHub and other sites.
- Facilitate navigation/search by allowing easy copying of the Target ID or Display Text.
- Support "Dendron" style links `[[Text|ID]]` as well as standard `[[ID|Text]]`.

### Decisions
1.  **Parsing Logic**:
    - Used a regex to detect `[[...]]` patterns.
    - Implemented a check for `\d{14}-` (timestamp pattern) to distinguish between the ID and the display text, especially for Dendron support where the order might be swapped.
    - Default fallback: If no pipe `|` is present, the whole content is treated as both ID and Text.

2.  **User Interface**:
    - A simple popup allows users to toggle the "Copy Mode".
    - Modes:
        1.  **Target ID** (default): Copies the ID (e.g., `20251231140239-target`).
        2.  **ID + Description**: Copies both (e.g., `20251231140239-target Display Text`) - chosen to facilitate broad searches.
        3.  **Description Only**: Copies only the text.

3.  **Storage**:
    - Uses `chrome.storage.local` to persist user preferences for the copy mode.

4.  **Visuals**:
    - Links are styled with a distinct blue background and dashed underline to indicate interactivity.
    - A toast (floating notification) provides immediate feedback upon copying.

### Analytics
- No external analytics implemented (privacy-first).
- "Analytics" in this RFC context refers to the analysis of the user problem:
    - **Problem**: Raw wikilinks `[[ID|Text]]` are hard to read and hard to copy manually for searching.
    - **Solution**: Automated parsing and click-to-copy functionality solves this friction.

## Future Improvements
- Add context menu support.
- Allow customizable regex patterns for different wikilink styles.
- Support "Click to Navigate" if a URL scheme is defined.
